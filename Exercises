Exercise 1)

Suppose we have an array with starting address stored in $s0. We want to add the content of the first three elements, and put the result in the fourth element? 
A[3] = A[2] + A[1] + A[0]

Nice To Do;
- Instead of having an array with 3 elements, define array size from user input.
- Instead of adding all elements before the last and then store the result to last element, follow this algorithm instead; At every element through the array, store the addition of the previous elements.
